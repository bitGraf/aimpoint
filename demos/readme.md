## Spinning Rigid Body
A rigid body with principal moments of inertia $I_1 < I_2 < I_3$ is initialized with an initial $\bar{\omega}$ around its body $y$-axis, with small perturbing velocities in the other two axes. As expected, the body is rotating around an unstable principle axis and so tumbles in a chaotic but predictible way.
